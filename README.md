# React Native Sample

This repo contains some sample code showing how to create a straightforward login view for a mobile application using React Native, as well as how
the file structure could look potentially.

To build it, ensure you have npm installed on your device to download all packages, as well as Android Studio to create a virtual android device.
After installing all packages and launching a virtual android device from Android Studio, simply open the folder you have downloaded the code into and type into
a powershell window the following command: ``npx react-native run-android`` - this should launch everything that is needed to bundle and compile the app
onto the virtual device you're running.
